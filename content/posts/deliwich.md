This is how I order my Subway sandwich when I'm craving a chicken salad sandwich from [a local deli in Arlington, VA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chelsea+Market+%26+Deli/@38.8899495,-77.0883377,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89b7b6898d3c73c9:0x99ee4c06aa82f106!8m2!3d38.8899454!4d-77.0857628!16s%2Fg%2F11f2_5zs6n?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D):

|                           | 6" Grilled Chicken                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| bread                     | toasted artisan Italian                     |
| cheese                    | Provolone                                   |
| veggies                   | lettuce, red onion, tomato                  |
| dressing (regular amount) | regular mayonnaise, yellow mustard          |
| dressing (less)           | oil, peppercorn ranch, roasted garlic aioli |
| seasoning                 | black pepper                                |
There's no salad-y texture per se but it approximates well.
