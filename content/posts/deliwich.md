I'm usually always craving a chicken salad sandwich from [this one local deli in Arlington, VA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Euro+Market+%26+Cafe/@38.8912919,-77.0861325,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89b7b689e28ad2d7:0x69272a189440f6db!8m2!3d38.8912919!4d-77.0861325!16s%2Fg%2F1v6qjhx5?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). So I try and replicate that when I can.

But when I'm not up to it, Subway is convenient. This is my how I order:

|                           | 6" Grilled Chicken                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| bread                     | toasted artisan Italian                     |
| cheese                    | provolone                                   |
| veggies                   | lettuce, red onion, tomato                  |
| dressing (regular amount) | regular mayonnaise, yellow mustard          |
| dressing (less)           | oil, peppercorn ranch, roasted garlic aioli |
| seasoning                 | black pepper                                |

There's no salad-y texture per se but it approximates well. I would eat at said deli if I could but sometimes Subway is just more accessible.
