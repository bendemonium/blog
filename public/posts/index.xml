      <title>how much does first langauge matter when perceiving (and reacting to) other languages?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you asked me that in fourth grade, I would&amp;rsquo;ve said yes. My reasoning would have been simple: you often translate your thoughts into a certain language, after thinking your thoughts in your first language (first language here is whatever language your mind performs cognitive tasks in, apart from visuals - but usually those abstract visuals are also a product of your environment and the language you think in so it gets circular). This happens without your knowledge if you&amp;rsquo;re relatively used to speaking that language (usually in multilingual communities). If you&amp;rsquo;re new to this, you might want to think of how you would approach writing something in a language you&amp;rsquo;re just learning. You explicitly say something in the language you&amp;rsquo;re accustomed to thinking in, in your head, as you write down or say whatever you have to in this other, new language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
