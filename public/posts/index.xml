      <description>&lt;h5 id=&#34;set-up&#34;&gt;set-up&lt;/h5&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instruction:&lt;/strong&gt; say &lt;em&gt;RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trill the /r/ sound, or an allophone of it in your phonological inventory, and hold it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you do, look in the mirror. Observe the shape of your lips. Identify the shape closest to your mouth and make a mental note of it (just in case you try mimicking the other shapes as you &lt;em&gt;rrrrrr&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;![hello](/images/lipshape.png [lip shapes])&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: if you&amp;rsquo;re having a tough time identifying the shape, consider checking out this chart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>how much does first langauge matter when perceiving (and reacting to) other languages?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you asked me that in fourth grade, I would&amp;rsquo;ve said yes. My reasoning would have been simple: you often translate your thoughts into a certain language, after thinking your thoughts in your first language (first language here is whatever language your mind performs cognitive tasks in, apart from visuals - but usually those abstract visuals are also a product of your environment and the language you think in so it gets circular). This happens without your knowledge if you&amp;rsquo;re relatively used to speaking that language (usually in multilingual communities). If you&amp;rsquo;re new to this, you might want to think of how you would approach writing something in a language you&amp;rsquo;re just learning. You explicitly say something in the language you&amp;rsquo;re accustomed to thinking in, in your head, as you write down or say whatever you have to in this other, new language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
